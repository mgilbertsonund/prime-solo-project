                <h2>Understanding the Match Page</h2>
                <p>
                    On the match page, you will see a table displaying the odds offered by various bookmakers for each team. If a cell is highlighted in green, it means that the price is better than Pinnacle's price. These highlighted cells represent bets that should be considered due to their favorable odds, although they may not always indicate an arbitrage opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below this table, the "Suggested Arbitrage Bets" card identifies specific arbitrage opportunities. When this card is outlined in green, it signals a profitable arbitrage bet where you can place bets on all possible outcomes and ensure a profit regardless of the event's result.

                    In the example above, to secure a profit, a bettor should wager 
                    <span className="highlight-amount"> $60.88</span> at SuperBook on the Houston Astros Moneyline, and 
                    <span className="highlight-amount"> $39.19</span> at WynnBET on the Chicago White Sox Moneyline.
